## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Links

- Solution URL: [Repo](https://github.com/elian-dev/multi-step-form-main)
- Live Site URL: [Live site](https://multi-step-form-main-dusky.vercel.app/)


### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Custom HTML elements
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [ASTRO.js](https://astro.build/)
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learn how to prepare my project for future API integrations, and the complexity of managing a global state with vanilla js.
I wanted to use some observer APIs and learn more about them. 
My estimated time to finish this task was 3 days, but at the end it takes me one week, so I needed to continue practicing.

### Continued development

- How to estimate the time
- Analyze the componentization 
- How to create more reusable functions

### Useful resources

- [Web components with custom elements](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/client-side-scripts/#web-components-with-custom-elements) - This helped me because Astro doesn't let access to browsers API, and I was working with the local storage and observing events in the dom.
